# Modified CoLTP Face Retrival System
This feature descriptor which is named as CoALTP, inherits the attributes of both LTP and GLCM. First LTPs of pixels are obtained and then using GLCM in four directions, co-relations between pixel pairs are calculated as features. The PCA is used in order to reduce the dimension of the extracted features.
